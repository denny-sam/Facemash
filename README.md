This website is the implementation of the website "Facemash" shown in the movie "The Social Network". 
It has the same look and feel. It uses the classic Elo's formula.

Pics to be shuffled can be stored in a folder named facepics in the same folder. Pics should have the format "image(number).jpg"
The number is not a random number. It should be continuos to give best results. To do this, you can move all the images to a folder, select all of them using CTRL+A and then rename the first one as image(1). Rest of the images will be automatically renamed according to requirement.

The database requirements can be figured out using the code.
