This website is the implementation of the website "Facemash" shown in the movie "The Social Network". 
It has the same look and feel, except it is not very complete. It uses the classic Elo's formula.
Pics to be seen can be stored in a folder named facepics. Pics should have the format "image(<number>).jpg"
The numbers assigned to the pics should be contiguos.
